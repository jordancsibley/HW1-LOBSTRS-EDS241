#### DATA SOURCE:

Reed D. 2019. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0. Dataset accessed 11/17/2019.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

You're about to dive into some deep data collected from five reef sites in Santa Barbara County, all about the abundance of California spiny lobsters! ðŸ¦ž Data was gathered by divers annually from 2012 to 2018 across Naples, Mohawk, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado reefs.

Why lobsters? Well, this sample provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established on January 1, 2012 (Reed, 2019). Of these five reefs, Naples, and Isla Vista are MPAs, while the other three are not protected (non-MPAs). Comparing lobster health between these protected and non-protected areas gives us the chance to study how commercial and recreational fishing might impact these ecosystems.

We will consider the MPA sites the `treatment` group and use regression methods to explore whether protecting these reefs really makes a difference compared to non-MPA sites (our control group). In this assignment, weâ€™ll think deeply about which causal inference assumptions hold up under the research design and identify where they fall short. 

Letâ€™s break it down step by step and see what the data reveals! ðŸ“Š

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Anticipating potential sources of selection bias

**a.** Do the control sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) provide a strong counterfactual for our treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista)? Write a paragraph making a case for why this comparison is centris paribus or whether selection bias is likely (be specific!).  


I believe the control sites are a good counter factual for our treatment sites. From viewing the metadata (and working with this particular dataset a lot in undergrad), I know that all of the sites are relatively similar in habitat composition - the main difference being the level of protection. However, there is likely some room for bias due to some sites being closer to each other than others. There is a chance that these sites are more similar to each other just because of their physical distance. Additionally, there may be the bias due to the fact that lobsters are confined to the bounds of a site. The good news is, California Spiny lobsters do not travel far distances, and are known to remain in within a single crevice. However, once hatched, the larvae will often be transported by the currents until they settle to the bottom. So looking at population growth/decline within a LTER site over time might not be indicative of the reproduction of the adult lobsters. These ecological factors are important to consider when determining the level of bias between control and treatment sites. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Read & wrangle data

**a.** Read in the raw data. Name the data.frame (`df`) `rawdata`

**b.** Use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

```{r}
# HINT: check for coding of missing values (`na = "-99999"`)

# Read in spiny lobs data,, clean column names, and convert NA values  
rawdata <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'spiny_abundance_sb_18.csv')) |> 
    janitor::clean_names() |> 
    mutate(size_mm = na_if(size_mm, -99999))
    

```

**c.** Create a new `df` named `tidyata`. Using the variable `site` (reef location) create a new variable `reef` as a `factor` and add the following labels in the order listed (i.e., re-order the `levels`): 
    
    "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"

```{r}

# Create new df with factored sites 
tidydata <- rawdata |> 
    mutate(reef = factor(site, 
                         levels = c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK", "IVEE",  "NAPL"),
                         labels = c("Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples")))
    
```

Create new `df` named `spiny_counts` 

**d.** Create a new variable `counts` to allow for an analysis of lobster counts where the unit-level of observation is the total number of observed lobsters per `site`, `year` and `transect`. 

- Create a variable `mean_size` from the variable `size_mm`
- NOTE: The variable `counts` should have values which are integers (whole numbers). 
- Make sure to account for missing cases (`na`)!

**e.** Create a new variable `mpa` with levels `MPA` and `non_MPA`. For our regression analysis create a numerical variable `treat` where MPA sites are coded `1` and non_MPA sites are coded `0`

```{r}
#HINT(d): Use `group_by()` & `summarize()` to provide the total number of lobsters observed at each site-year-transect row-observation. 

#HINT(e): Use `case_when()` to create the 3 new variable columns

spiny_counts <- tidydata |>
    # group by to get total count of lobs per transect 
    group_by(year, site, transect) |> 
    summarise(counts = sum(count),
              mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
    # create new column that gives protection status 
    mutate(mpa = case_when(site %in% c('AQUE', 'CARP', 'MOHK') ~ 'non-MPA',
    TRUE ~ 'MPA')) |> 
    # create column where mpa = 1 and non-mpas = 0 
    mutate(treat = case_when(mpa == 'non-MPA' ~ 0, 
                             mpa == 'MPA' ~ 1)) |> 
    ungroup()
```

> NOTE: This step is crucial to the analysis. Check with a friend or come to TA/instructor office hours to make sure the counts are coded correctly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Explore & visualize data

**a.** Take a look at the data! Get familiar with the data in each `df` format (`tidydata`, `spiny_counts`)

**b.** We will focus on the variables `count`, `year`, `site`, and `treat`(`mpa`) to model lobster abundance. Create the following 4 plots using a different method each time from the 6 options provided. Add a layer (`geom`) to each of the plots including informative descriptive statistics (you choose; e.g., mean, median, SD, quartiles, range). Make sure each plot dimension is clearly labeled (e.g., axes, groups).

- [Density plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/density-plot-group-ggplot2)
- [Ridge plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/ggridges/)
- [Jitter plot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html) 
- [Violin plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/violin-plot-group-ggplot2) 
- [Histogram](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/) 
- [Beeswarm](https://r-charts.com/distribution/beeswarm/)

Create plots displaying the distribution of lobster **counts**:

1) grouped by reef site  
2) grouped by MPA status
3) grouped by year

Create a plot of lobster **size** :

4) You choose the grouping variable(s)!

```{r}
# plot 1: ridge plot of lobs counts grouped by reef site (with mean counts)

# Calculate mean counts 
mean_counts <- spiny_counts |> 
  group_by(site) |> 
  summarize(mean_count = mean(counts))

# Plot 
spiny_counts %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = counts, y = site, fill = site)) + 
    ggridges::geom_density_ridges() + 
    # add text of mean counts 
    geom_text(data = mean_counts, 
              aes(x = max(spiny_counts$counts) + 2,
                  y = (site),
              label = paste0("Mean counts: ", round(mean_count, 1))),
              hjust = 1,
              vjust = -.8,
              size = 3) +
    theme_light() + 
    # remove legend 
    theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    labs(x = "Lobster counts per transect",
         y = "LTER Site",
         title = "Density of Spiny Lobsters Counts Per LTER Site")
```

```{r}
# plot 2: histogram lobs counts grouped by MPA status (with median counts)

# Calculate medians for each mpa group
medians <- spiny_counts %>%
  group_by(mpa) %>%
  summarize(median_count = median(counts))

# Plot 
spiny_counts |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = counts)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = 'lightblue',
                   col = 'darkblue') + 
    facet_wrap(~mpa) + 
    # lines that show median 
    geom_vline(data = medians, aes(xintercept = median_count), 
               color = 'darkred', linetype = "dashed", size = 1) + 
    # median label 
    geom_text(data = medians, aes(x = median_count, y = -Inf, 
                                  label = paste0("Median: ", median_count)),
              hjust = -0.3, vjust = -8, color = "darkred", size = 4) + 
    # labels 
    labs(x = 'Lobster counts per transect',
         y = 'Frequency',
         title = 'Histogram of Lobster Counts per LTER sites (MPA vs Non-MPA)') + 
    theme_light()
```

```{r}
# plot 3: jitter plot lobs counts grouped by year (with max count)

# Identify max counts for each year
counts_max <- spiny_counts %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(is_max = counts == max(counts)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Plot 
counts_max |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = counts, col = year)) + 
    geom_jitter() + 
    # set x axis 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2012, 2018, by = 1)) + 
    # highlight the max count of each day 
    gghighlight::gghighlight(is_max, label_key = counts)  +
    # labels 
    labs(x = "Year",
         y = "Lobster Counts",
         title = "Maximum Lobster Counts per Year") + 
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# plot 4: Violin plot of lobs size_mm grouped by mpa status 
spiny_counts |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mpa, y = mean_size, fill = mpa)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, color = "black", alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("non-MPA" = "#FF9999", "MPA" = "#99CCFF")) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + # Remove the legend
  labs(x = "MPA Status",
       y = "Mean Size (mm)",
       title = "Comparison of Mean Lobster Size in MPA and Non-MPA Areas"
  )
```


**c.** Compare means of the outcome by treatment group. Using the `tbl_summary()` function from the package [`gt_summary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html) 

```{r}
# USE: gt_summary::tbl_summary()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: OLS regression- building intuition

**a.** Start with a simple OLS estimator of lobster counts regressed on treatment. Use the function `summ()` from the [`jtools`](https://jtools.jacob-long.com/) package to print the OLS output

**b.** Interpret the intercept & predictor coefficients *in your own words*. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the regression results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

```{r}
# NOTE: We will not evaluate/interpret model fit in this assignment (e.g., R-square)

# m1_ols <- 
# 
# summ(m1_ols, model.fit = FALSE) 

```

**c.** Check the model assumptions using the `check_model` function from the `performance` package

**d.** Explain the results of the 4 diagnostic plots. Why are we getting this result?

```{r}
#check_model(m1_ols,  check = "qq" )
```


```{r}
#check_model(m1_ols, check = "normality")
```


```{r}
#check_model(m1_ols, check = "homogeneity")
```


```{r}
#check_model(m1_ols, check = "pp_check")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Fitting GLMs

**a.** Estimate a Poisson regression model using the `glm()` function

**b.** Interpret the predictor coefficient in your own words. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

**c.** Explain the statistical concept of dispersion and overdispersion in the context of this model. 

**d.** Compare results with previous model, explain change in the significance of the treatment effect

```{r}
#HINT1: Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR): Exponentiation of beta returns coefficient which is interpreted as the 'percent change' for a one unit increase in the predictor 

#HINT2: For the second glm() argument `family` use the following specification option `family = poisson(link = "log")`

#m2_pois <- 

```

**e.** Check the model assumptions. Explain results.

**f.** Conduct tests for over-dispersion & zero-inflation. Explain results.

```{r}
#check_model(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
#check_overdispersion(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
#check_zeroinflation(m2_pois)
```

**g.** Fit a negative binomial model using the function glm.nb() from the package `MASS` and check model diagnostics 

**h.** In 1-2 sentences explain rationale for fitting this GLM model.

**i.** Interpret the treatment estimate result in your own words. Compare with results from the previous model.

```{r}

# NOTE: The `glm.nb()` function does not require a `family` argument

#m3_nb <- 

```


```{r}
#check_overdispersion(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
#check_zeroinflation(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
#check_predictions(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
#check_model(m3_nb)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Compare models 

**a.** Use the `export_summ()` function from the `jtools` package to look at the three regression models you fit side-by-side.

**c.** Write a short paragraph comparing the results. Is the treatment effect `robust` or stable across the model specifications. 

```{r}

# export_summs(# ADD MODELS
#              model.names = c("OLS","Poisson", "NB"),
#              statistics = "none")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Building intuition - fixed effects

**a.** Create  new `df` with the `year` variable converted to a factor

**b.** Run the following negative binomial model using `glm.nb()`

- Add fixed effects for `year` (i.e., dummy coefficients)
- Include an interaction term between variables `treat` & `year` (`treat*year`)

**c.** Take a look at the regression output. Each coefficient provides a comparison or the difference in means for a specific sub-group in the data. Informally, describe the what the model has estimated at a conceptual level (NOTE: you do not have to interpret coefficients individually)

**d.** Explain why the main effect for treatment is negative? *Does this result make sense?

```{r}

# ff_counts <- spiny_counts %>% 
#     mutate(year=as_factor(year))
#     
# m5_fixedeffs <- glm.nb(
#     counts ~ 
#         treat +
#         year +
#         treat*year,
#     data = ff_counts)
# 
# summ(m5_fixedeffs, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**e.** Look at the model predictions: Use the `interact_plot()` function from package `interactions` to plot mean predictions by year and treatment status. 

**f.** Re-evaluate your responses (c) and (b) above. 

```{r}

# interact_plot(m5_fixedeffs, pred = year, modx = treat,
#               outcome.scale = "link") # NOTE: y-axis on log-scale

# HINT: Change `outcome.scale` to "response" to convert y-axis scale to counts
```

**g.** Using `ggplot()` create a plot in same style as the previous `interaction plot`, but displaying the original scale of the outcome variable (lobster counts). This type of plot is commonly used to show how the treatment effect changes across discrete time points (i.e., panel data).

The plot should have... 
- `year` on the x-axis
- `counts` on the y-axis
- `mpa` as the grouping variable


```{r}
# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

# plot_counts <- 

# plot_counts %>% ggplot() ...
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 8: Reconsider causal identification assumptions

a. Discuss whether you think `spillover effects` are likely in this research context (see Glossary of terms; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIudsVcYhWGpqC-Uftk9UTz3PIq6stVyEpT44EPNgpE/edit?usp=sharing)
b. Explain why spillover is an issue for the identification of causal effects
c. How does spillover relate to impact in this research setting?
d. Discuss the following causal inference assumptions in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. Evaluate if each of the assumption are reasonable: 
    
    1) SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption 
    2) Excludability assumption

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EXTRA CREDIT

> Use the recent lobster abundance data with observations collected up until 2024 (`lobster_sbchannel_24.csv`) to run an analysis evaluating the effect of MPA status on lobster counts using the same focal variables.

a. Create a new script for the analysis on the updated data
b. Run at least 3 regression models & assess model diagnostics
c. Compare and contrast results with the analysis from the 2012-2018 data sample (~ 2 paragraphs)
